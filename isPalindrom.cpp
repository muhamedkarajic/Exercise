/*
A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward or forward.

Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored.

For example:

isPalindrome("Deleveled") should return true as character case should be ignored, 
Resulting in "deleveled", which is a palindrome since it reads the same backward and forward.
